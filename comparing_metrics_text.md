#### Results of the calculations with the whole dataset
- You can choose a genome release in combination with a CADD version and then choose the metrics you would like to look at. Then a line graph will load. You can hover over the lines to see specific data or zoom in, as well as change the range of the x-axis.
- You can also look at the distribution of the variants for the different thresholds for your chosen CADD version and genome release. It is possible to adjust the x-axis for the more small-scaled bar chart.
- If you want to know the consequences of all the pathogenic variants at different threshold, you may look at the last bar chart. (the likely pathogenic variants have a lower opacity)
