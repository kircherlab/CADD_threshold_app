#### Distributions
- You can also look at the distribution of the variants for the different thresholds for your chosen CADD version and genome release. It is possible to adjust the x-axis for the more small-scaled bar chart.
- If you want to know the consequences of all the pathogenic variants at different threshold, you may look at the last bar chart. (the likely pathogenic variants have a lower opacity)
